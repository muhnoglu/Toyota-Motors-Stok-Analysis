This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Toyota Motors data. The study consists of the following steps:

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning and Manipulation**
   - Handled missing values.
   - Standardized data formats.
   - Performed feature engineering to enhance dataset usability.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Conducted in-depth visualizations to uncover patterns and insights in the data.
   - Analyzed correlations and trends to guide model development.

3. **Modeling and Evaluation**
   - Built and trained a machine learning model to predict target outcomes.
   - Evaluated the model using test data:

    Test Loss (MSE)
